# SpacedRepetition

Have you ever wondered why you tend to forget concepts soon after you learned them? I know I have done that plenty of times in my life. This is where Spaced Repetition comes in and has changed my memory retention capabilities significantly and it can do the same for you as well!

Spaced repetition is a technique used by many where you revisit the concepts multiple times at irregular intervals. That is, you keep expanding the interval between subsequent reviews and the idea is to review at a point where you are just about to forget the material.

This chrome extension can be used for anything and everything! You read an interesting article or informative blog that you want to remember long term? Simply add a task to this extension and review it a few times so that the information gets stored in the long term memory!

This code is also open source so please feel free to check it out at https://github.com/amishpatel1994/SpacedRepetition and contribute :D! Thanks in advance.

I hope the extension helps your life! Please post any feedback you may have as github issue and I'll look into it ASAP.
